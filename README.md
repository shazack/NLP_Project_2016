# NLP_Project
The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on the IMDB Movie reviews.

Given a review, we are interested in predicting a user’s attitude towards the movie

The labeled data set consists of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews, specially selected for sentiment analysis.

The sentiment of reviews is binary, meaning the IMDB rating < 5 results in a sentiment score of 0, and rating ≥ 7 have a sentiment score of 1.

No individual movie has more than 30 reviews.

The 25,000 review labeled training set does not include any of the same movies as the 25,000 review test set. In addition, there are another 50,000 IMDB reviews provided without any rating labels.
